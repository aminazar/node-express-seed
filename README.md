# Node/Express Seed
## Basic database setup
This seed is based its tests on PostgreSQL database connection in local server.

Check config.json to ensure the connection is matching your need.
Choose a meaningful name for 'database' like **my_project**, and run:
> npm install

In addition to downloading modules, it will create a pair of databases:

* my_project
* my_project_test

The latter will be used only for testing purpose.
